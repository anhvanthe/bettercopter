/** Altitude hold controller 
The controller PID determines how many units to increase throttle in 
order to quickly reach desired altitude. If set to 50 then for 1 meter 
difference we will increase throttle 50 units. 

The I term is particularly important because without it we may never 
reach target altitude becuase of weight. 

Normally, at ground level we have about 8cm altitude (0.08m). This 
means that we will have throttle a little below hover point. When we are
down at the ground level however (below 0.15m), we need to gradually 
increase throttle until the copter lifts off. Once we are in the air, 
we can increase or decrease the set point to hover.
