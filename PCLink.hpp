/**
PCLink uses a JSON based protocol and parses the incoming data once 
there is something to parse. It uses a set of primitive commands to 
set and get configuration values. 

To set a configuration variable, this is set to the PC link. As a 
result of this, it will call OnSetValue(name, value) of the listener: 
{"set": "some_name", "value": "some_value"}

To get a value, use this: 
{"get": "some_name"}

Values are represented as strings, and should be converted by 
application code.
